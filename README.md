# WBIB-Google
A cross-website formatter for WBIB, because redirects break it, sigh.

# Basic Documentation
- ## Google Search Formatter
  Used when attempting to search Google for something, because actually going to Google.com and searching something will give an error or do nothing. Simply input a search term, and voila! Copy and paste the link into WBIB.
- ## General Website Formatter
  Used when you are using Reddit or another tool and you want to visit that cool-looking link and it redirects you and you're sad. What do you do? Use this formatter, of course! First, find what website you're on. If it's Reddit, you put https://reddit.com in the first slot. Twitter, https://twitter.com. Anything like that! Now, for that cool link your were looking at, right click it. Copy the link address and input it as the second slot. Now, press the button, and the resulting link you can copy and paste into WBIB and you'll see everything that site has to offer!
